  1800: "Early mechanical computing devices, such as Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine (1830s) and Ada Lovelace's first algorithm (1840s), lay the foundation for future programming concepts.",
  1940: 'The first electronic computers are developed, such as the Colossus (1943) and ENIAC (1946). Assembly language programming begins to emerge.',
  1950: 'The first high-level programming languages are created, including Fortran (1957) by IBM and COBOL (1959) by the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL).',
  1960: 'The development of more high-level programming languages continues, with languages such as LISP (1958), ALGOL (1958), and BASIC (1964) gaining popularity. Simula (1967) introduces object-oriented programming concepts.',
  1970: 'Programming languages such as C (1972) by Dennis Ritchie and Prolog (1972) emerge. The concept of structured programming gains traction, with languages like Pascal (1970) by Niklaus Wirth and Modula (1977).',
  1980: 'Object-oriented programming becomes mainstream, with languages like Smalltalk (1980), C++ (1983) by Bjarne Stroustrup, and Objective-C (1984). The first version of the now-popular Python language is created by Guido van Rossum in 1989.',
  1990: 'The World Wide Web is born, and web programming languages like HTML (1990), JavaScript (1995), and PHP (1995) emerge. Java (1995) by Sun Microsystems gains popularity due to its platform independence.',
  2000: "The rise of open-source software leads to the development of languages like Ruby (1995) and Ruby on Rails (2005), and the growth of the Python ecosystem. Mobile app development gains momentum with the release of Apple's iOS SDK (2008) and Google's Android SDK (2008).",
  2010: 'Programming languages focus on concurrency, safety, and ease of use. Notable examples include Go (2009) by Google, Rust (2010) by Mozilla, and Swift (2014) by Apple. Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow (2015) and PyTorch (2016) become popular.',
  2020: 'The field of programming continues to evolve with the development of new languages, frameworks, and paradigms. Quantum computing and artificial intelligence drive advancements in the field.'
